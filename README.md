# Project-2020---Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis

Introduction: The aim of the project is to perform and explain 'Simple Linear Regression' using Python on the following dataset (powerproduction dataset) - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmcloughlin/2020A-machstat-project/master/dataset/powerproduction.csv.

Prerequisites Before commencing, please ensure you have the following requirements • Software package (Cmder) • Anaconda • Windows • Code Editor (Visual Studio Code) • Jupyter Notebook

Installing/Getting started A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a Project 2020 up & running.

Installation • Install cmder software package https://cmder.net/ • Install code editor, visual studio code https://code.visualstudio.com/ • Install python https://www.anaconda.com/

Prepare • Open cmder • Open jupyter notebook

Run code • in cmder run jupyter notebook code

Assignment Details: 
In the project the objective is to perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset. 
The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
The minimum submission are the following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

Assignment Format: 
- import libraries
- import dataset
- view dataset
- plot dataset (to view the location of the points on the plot)
- best fit line to linear regression
- Analysis
- Alternative Regression
- Analysis
- References

Assignment content
- Looking at the dataset and analysing
- adding a best fit line using simple linear regression
- analysing the results
- predicting some future results
- looking at the dataset using polynominal regression
- analysing the results
